=====================================================================================================

WikiScrape is a tool which can be useful for easily creating or moving Mediawikis without access
to the old / copied Mediawiki server. This tool can be used to successfully gather all of the 
titles to the pages within the old / copied wiki, and to also gather all of the images from the 
old /copied Mediawiki server. In this way, it is possible to use Mediawiki's own tools to import
the pages and import the images as well. Access to the new Mediawiki server is required to import
the images.

Installation
    * To install, simply clone / download this repository and compile the golang code.
    * Either use go get [git url to here] or download this and go build on the directory.

Requirements
    * A Golang compiler is required.

How to use
    * To download images, use the -images flag. To download the titles, use the -titles flag.
    * Example: wikiScrape -images "[URL for file list]" -titles "[URL for Ancient Pages]"

Link Usage
    * For right now, it is really important to use the correct link for the Mediawiki depending
      which flag you are using.
    * For the -image flag:
        - The URL should be obtained from the wiki's Special Page's File List.
        - Once on the File List page, click the box which determines how many files are displayed
          on one page and change to 500.
        - Click on "Go" or "Search".
        - This should bring up a page which has up to 500 of the images. Copy this link and use
          with the -images flag.
        - #NOTE#: For now, wikiScrape only works on wikis with 500 or less images. To find more than
          500 images, you'll have to first download the first set and then move pages and use that link.
    * For the -titles flag:
        - The URL should be obtained from the wiki's Special Page's Oldest Pages.
        - Once on the Oldest Pages (also known as 'Ancient Pages'), click the box which determines how
          many pages are displayed.
        - Change the value to 500 and press 'Go'.
        - This is the link which should be used with the -titles flag.
        - #NOTE#: For now, wikiScrape only works on wikis with 500 or less pages. To find more than
          500 pages, you'll have to first download the first set and then move pages and use that link.
